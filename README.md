**Puyo Pop Fever Re:Chained** is a modified version of the Puyo Puyo Fever DX (Chinese ForceGen Version) mobile game with many features, major improvements, and implementations. This mod will give you a *Puyo Puyo Fever 2*-like experience with the original Puyo Puyo Fever storylines.

This mod includes 2 versions, the **Full** version and the low-end or stripped down version called the **LITE** version. The Full version bundled with 2 variants with the audio type, WAV and AMR. The AMR variant supports for most devices, but it has lower-quality SFX, while the WAV variant supports for some devices with higher-quality SFX (11025 Hz) and lower latency (Depends on the phone's CPU).

**The Full version includes many features:**
* New Town Map / Stage Select System,
* New Menu / In-Game Graphics,
* Variable Puyo Skins (Available in Gummy, Aqua (Default), Retro, and Fever),
* Sound Effects and English/Japanese Voices (It can be changed in settings),
* Supports for J2ME-enabled devices higher than 240x320 (QVGA),
* QWERTY keyboard support, and
* Major bug fixes.

However, the full version only works with higher-end J2ME-enabled phones (e.g. Nokia Series 40 v6, Nokia/SE Symbian, Sony Ericsson, Samsung, LG) and most J2ME emulators (e.g J2ME Loader / JL-Mod, KEmulator Lite 0.9.3 / 1.0.3 mod). This version does NOT compatible with lower-end Samsung, LG, Nokia Series 40 v3/v4/v5, and other phones.

**The LITE version lacks some features:**
* No Town Map / Stage Select System,
* No Sound Effects and Voices,
* Simplified Menu, and
* Only one Puyo skin available is Aqua.

This version supports most lower-end Samsung, LG, Nokia Series 40 v3/v4/v5, and other phones.
